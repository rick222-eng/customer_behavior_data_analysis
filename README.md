Data Analysis Project
Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow using Python, SQL, and visualization tools. It covers data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning and transformation, SQL-based analysis using PostgreSQL, and the creation of interactive dashboards and presentation-ready reports.

The goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights from raw data and present them in a clear, business-friendly format.

Tools & Technologies

Python (Data Analysis & Processing)

pandas

numpy

matplotlib / seaborn

PostgreSQL (SQL querying and analysis)

SQL (Data extraction and aggregation)

Interactive Dashboards

Power BI / Tableau / Plotly (as applicable)

Gamma AI

Automated presentation (PPT) generation

Jupyter Notebook

Dataset

The dataset is loaded using Python.

It contains structured data suitable for analysis and visualization.

Key steps applied:

Handling missing values

Removing duplicates

Data type corrections

Feature transformation and normalization

Dataset source and description can be added here if public.
